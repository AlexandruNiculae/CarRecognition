# CarRecognition


#Requirements:
  - [Pillow][pillow_link]
  - [Tensorflow][tensorflow_link]
  - [Keras][keras_link]


#Objective:
Compare the differences between Tensorflow and Keras when it comes to Convolutional Networks. Both libraries are used for Machine Learning and other Artificial Intelligence related research.
The question we are trying to answer is which one is more programmer friendly and which one is more efficient or more powerful.

In order to compare them on a different and much more complicated dataset rather than MNIST, we will use a dataset of cars in which the network is tasked with recognizing the car's producer from the image.

#Convolutional Networks:
  Here we are comparing the Convolutional Networks provided by each tutorial
#State of the Art:
1.Tensorflow:  
  **blah blah blah**  

2.Keras:  
  **blah blah blah**


#Our Results:
1.Tensorflow:  
  **blah blah blah**

2.Keras:  
  **blah blah blah**
