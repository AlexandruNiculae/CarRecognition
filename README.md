# CarRecognition      


##Requirements:
  - [Pillow][pillow_link]
  - [Tensorflow][tensorflow_link]
  - [Keras][keras_link]


##Objective:
Compare the differences between Tensorflow and Keras when it comes to Convolutional Networks. Both libraries are used for Machine Learning and other Artificial Intelligence related research.
The question we are trying to answer is which one is more programmer friendly and which one is more efficient or more powerful.

In order to compare them on a different and much more complicated dataset rather than MNIST, we will use a dataset of cars in which the network is tasked with recognizing the car's producer from the image.

##Convolutional Networks:
  Here we are comparing the Convolutional Networks provided by each tutorial    

##From the tutorial:  

  Here we want to see what are the results from the guides that each of the frameworks provide.  

1.Tensorflow:  
  According to [this guide][tf_guide], Tensorflow obtains an average of 99.2% on the MNIST dataset.  

2.Keras:  
  The [Keras guide][k_guide] results in an accuracy of ??? for MNIST.   


##Our Results:  
Here are the results that we obtained using the [Stanford dataset of cars][cars_data] instead of MNIST.

1.Tensorflow:  
  **TBC**

2.Keras:  
  **TBC**


##Conclusions:  
After this experiment these are our conclusions regarding each of the technologies in which we worked.
